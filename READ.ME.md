- Project Title: Frontend of Fitness Tracker Application.

- Team Name: 200s

- Team members: Nour Saad, Haya Mazyad, Lynn Oueidat, Rama Alassi.
- Link to the deployed application:

- Data Entities: Users, Exercises, Workouts, and Progress Logs.

-We added a mock data file in the data folder, which includes arrays for Users, Exercises, Workouts, and Progress Logs. These arrays are imported by the pages and used to simulate user interaction with the web application, as there is no backend to store the information yet.

Detailed setup instructions for running the frontend locally:
terminal:
	1 - change the directory to the project folder
	2 - run the command: npm install
	3 - run the command: npm run dev
copy the provided link and paste it the browser of choice.

Workload Division:
To ensure consistency in theme and design across all pages, we collaboratively worked on the shared files (index.css, index.html, App.jsx, components, etc.). However, the pages were divided equally among us as follows:

Nour Saad:
1 - LogWorkout
2 - UserProgress
3 - NotFound

Rama Alassi:
1 - Homepage
2 - Login 
3 - Register

Lynn Oueidat:
1 - ExerciseDetails
2 - ExerciseLibrary


Haya Mazyad:
1 - WorkoutDashboard
2 - WorkoutDetails
